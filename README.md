## About :star:!
OracleLock is a decentralized program that manages the security of oracles within the blockchain industry. An oracle serves a conduit between the blockchain and real-world sending data in and out. Oracles feed smart contracts data, answers questions about the world and controls the inputs to the smart contracts. For prediction markets in DeFi, the oracle is the main data source that inputs necessary real-time data to the oracle. Chainlink and Gnosis are the best known crypto projects with oracle capibilities. OracleLock is step for the oracle problem with 0 centralization. OracleLock ensures oracle safety and security during transcations.

## Inspiration
Cloud storage platforms, from AWS, to GCP, to Oracle, and more have been leading the conversation as go-to applications for data storage. However, with the rise of blockchain technology, decentralized storage solutions create an opportunity for organizations and developers to securely safeguard their data, build better products, offer better services, and expose their projects to the Web3 ecosystem. With OracleLock, the goal was to create a solution that could serve as a conduit between applications and decentralized data storage while addressing the oracle problem in DeFi.

## What it does
For this iteration of OracleLock we used an example where have 4 functions in the smart contract that request oracle data. A unit test was conducted to verify if the data was accurate or not.

## How we built it
The storage portion was done using STORJ and IPFS, the leading decentralized cloud projects in the blockchain industry. For the front-end, we used Figma, Proto, and Flutter.

## Challenges we ran into
Utilizing Flutter was the biggest hurdle but Youtube university was most helpful. The packages we were downloading and the CLI commands were creating issues. Instead we used Flutter Cloud and Proto.io.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The biggest accomplishment was using STORJ and IPFS in tandem.

## What we learned
Focus on back-end then front-end. A lot more time is required for back-end development.

## What's next for OracleLock
Improving the front-end. I'd like to make the app compatible for every oracle, not just for Chainlink.
